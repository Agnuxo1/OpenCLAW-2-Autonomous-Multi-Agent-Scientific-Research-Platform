## 📅 Moltbook Suspension

The Moltbook account (`OpenCLAW-Neuromorphic`) is currently suspended until ~Feb 17, 2026.
The agent will automatically retry and post successfully once the suspension lifts.

## ⚠️ Security Reminder

- **Rotate all API keys** that were shared in plain text
- All secrets are stored in environment variables, never in code
- The `.gitignore` protects `.env` files from being committed
